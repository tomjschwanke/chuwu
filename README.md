# chuwu
Minecraft Plugin to transform chat to UwU language

Listens to all chat messages via an EventListener and replaces all 'R', 'r', 'L', 'l' with 'W' or 'w' respectively.

Currently it is active all time time and for everyone. Planning to make it toggleable with a command for players.

## bStats
This plugin uses [bStats](https://bstats.org/) which collects metrics about the server its running on.

To opt out, edit the `/plugins/bstats/config.yml` in your server folder.
